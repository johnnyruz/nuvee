INSTRUCTIONS:
0- Install official PCSX2 1.6.0 first
1- Copy dll to your emu's 'plugins' folder
2- Set plugin to nuvee

4- Hit acquire. choose game profile
5- (Optional) Hit acquire alternate to enable a secondary device for button presses (eg. Time Crisis Foot Pedal)
5- Play game




NOTES:

(1)
You can exit the emu, change the profiles settings and continue your game
(tweak aiming values on-the-fly)


(2)
Lightguns work best at 640x480 but higher resolutions like 1366x768 work well also


(3)
Real lightguns will work much better than using a mouse
(calibration, Time Crisis Zone submachine gun auto-fire)



(4)
Keyboard D-pad mapping:
W = up
A = Left
S = Down
D = Right

Q = Start
E = Select
F = Button C


Note that using Lilypad or SSSPSX pads can possibly interfere if WASD is
mapped to a joypad.


You can use nuvee_ps2_pad and set controllers to 'None'. Except in the
case of Starsky and Hutch (pad1 = driver, usb1 = shooter)

Or use Lilypad to set controller to 'Unplugged'



(5)
Take note that Lilypad can cause conflicts with USB plugin
- Keyboard = Windows Messaging / DirectInput (best)
- Mouse = None (best)
